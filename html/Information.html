        vacuums and mops your floor while doing so. The Braava can also mop more than 300 square feet
        during a single cleaning cycle, or expand to 1,000 square feet if your floors just need a good
        sweeping. It loosens dirt and sticky messes without spraying furniture, rugs or walls.</p>

      <p id="ppp">Farmers spray entire fields when using pesticides, counting on their crops to withstand the herbicide, leaving the pesticides to only kill the “pests”. However, pesticides harm more than the insects and weeds that threaten the crops. Robots can help resolve this problem. EcoRobotix, a robotic table on wheels is able to target spraying in order to prevent over-spraying. Fitted with a solar panel to keep it running, it uses its two arms to reach down and cover weeds before spraying them without the herbicide spreading further.</p>

      <p id="ppp">Аlong developed riverbanks, physical barriers can help contain flooding and combat erosion. In arid regions, check dams can help retain soil after rainfall and restore damaged landscapes. These applications and more, can be addressed with the use of sheet piles. We have developed a robot that can autonomously drive interlocking steel sheet piles into soil. The structures it builds could function as retaining walls or check dams for erosion control. </p>
