            Our aim is to improve the world with our robots. We build robots that help with everyday tasks, 
                                               and even global crises! 
                        There are many problems in the world and we hope that we can change that.
                              We have assembled a team, that will help us with that task.
                  We build robots that help with global warming, shipping which in turn helps with solving 
                             world hunger, housework, everyday difficulties, and more.
